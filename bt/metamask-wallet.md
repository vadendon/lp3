## Title
Create your own wallet using Metamask for crypto transactions

## Steps

1. Open MetaMask

Open your browser and click on the MetaMask icon (usually in the extensions bar).
If this is your first time using MetaMask, it will prompt you to either create a new wallet or import an existing one.

2. Create a New Wallet

Click on the option "Create a Wallet".
MetaMask will ask you if you want to help improve the wallet by providing usage data. You can choose "No Thanks" or "I Agree", depending on your preference.

3. Set a Strong Password

You will be asked to create a password for your wallet. This password is used to unlock MetaMask on your device. It is essential that you remember this password, but it is not used to recover your wallet.
Password Tips: Use a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols to ensure your password is secure.

4. Secure Your Secret Recovery Phrase

MetaMask will now give you a 12-word Secret Recovery Phrase (also known as a seed phrase). This is the most critical part of the wallet creation process.
Important: Write down the 12-word seed phrase on paper and store it in a very safe place. Do not share this phrase with anyone, and never store it digitally (e.g., on your phone or computer), as anyone with this phrase can access your wallet and all of its funds.

5. Confirm the Recovery Phrase

MetaMask will ask you to confirm the recovery phrase by selecting the words in the correct order. This ensures you’ve backed it up correctly.
Once done, MetaMask will confirm that your wallet has been successfully created.

6. Your Wallet is Ready!

After confirming the recovery phrase, you will be taken to the MetaMask dashboard. Here, you can view your wallet address and manage your crypto assets.
You now have your very own Ethereum wallet, and you’re ready to make crypto transactions.
